# Dynamic calender
A calendar that is linked to a Flask server made in Python. The server gathers all the necessary data for the months of the current year and combines them and sends them to the HTML file.
The day of any month can be selected in the HTML file and can be submitted to the server. The server can now perform any operations based on the data. The data that is sent to the server is in the format: daymonth; eg: 05apr, 18Mar, 01Jun.
